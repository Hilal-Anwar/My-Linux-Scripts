12A delta forms where a river, delta laden with sediment, slows down as it enters a larger body of water, like a sea or lake. The slowing velocity causes the sediment – clay, silt, sand, and even gravel – to be deposited, creating a new landform known as a river delta.i
13 delta fertile delta regions are crucial ecosystems, supporting a wealth of biodiversity, including pliants, fish, and birds. They also provide vital agricultural land and are often home to large human populations. Famous examples include the Nile River Delta, the Ganges River Delta, and the Mississippi River Delta. The shape of a delta can vary widely, from arcuate (fan-shaped), like the Nile delta, to bird's-foot shaped, like the Mississippi River delta. Even the very word "delta" itself comes from the Greek letter, whose triangular shape often resembles these geological formations.
